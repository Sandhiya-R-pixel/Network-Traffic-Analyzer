Project Title

Network Traffic Analyzer using Wireshark for Smart City Management

SDG Alignment

SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities
Goal: Make cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.

1. Introduction

Smart cities depend on interconnected systems such as smart traffic lights, surveillance cameras, IoT devices, and public Wi-Fi networks. These networks generate large amounts of data and require constant monitoring to ensure performance, security, and reliability.

A Network Traffic Analyzer helps monitor, analyze, and troubleshoot data flow between devices. Wireshark, an open-source network protocol analyzer, can capture and visualize packets in real-time—making it ideal for ensuring smooth communication in smart city infrastructures.

2. Objectives

To monitor and analyze real-time network traffic in a smart city network setup.

To identify potential security threats or network inefficiencies.

To optimize data transfer between IoT devices and servers.

To ensure reliable and sustainable digital infrastructure for urban management.

3. Tools & Technologies

Wireshark – For packet capture and analysis.

Network Simulator or IoT Devices – To simulate smart city components.

Operating System – Windows/Linux.

Protocols Analyzed – TCP, UDP, HTTP, MQTT, ICMP, etc.

4. Methodology

Setup Smart City Network Simulation

Create a virtual or small-scale network (e.g., traffic cameras, sensors, control servers).

Capture Network Traffic

Use Wireshark to capture live packets from the network.

Analyze Data

Identify bandwidth usage, latency, packet loss, and protocol distribution.

Detect Anomalies

Monitor unusual activities (e.g., packet floods, unauthorized access).

Suggest Improvements

Recommend better routing, device configuration, or security measures.

5. Expected Outcomes

Efficient monitoring of network health and data flow.

Early detection of cyber threats or performance bottlenecks.

Improved sustainability through optimized network resource usage.

Enhanced reliability and security of smart city systems.

6. Contribution to SDG 11

Promotes sustainable infrastructure by reducing data loss and energy consumption.

Enhances urban safety by ensuring uninterrupted operation of IoT-based public services.

Supports innovation and efficiency in smart governance and city management.

7. Conclusion

Using Wireshark as a network traffic analyzer can significantly contribute to building smarter, safer, and more sustainable cities. By ensuring robust communication among IoT systems, the project aligns with SDG 11—advancing toward sustainable urban development.
